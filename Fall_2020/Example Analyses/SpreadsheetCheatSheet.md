This tutorial relies on an example data set of 15 imagined survey responses. The goal of this example survey is to determine in which state one should run advertisements for the upcoming professional football season to attract viewers who don't currently watch much professional football.

The codebook for this imagined survey is available <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Sweitzer/Comm3163/blob/master/Fall_2020/Example%20Analyses/Codebook.md">here</a>. Users of Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Libre Calc should all be able to open the .xlsx containing the data, which is available here. However, because references to other sheets in Numbers follows a different formatting structure, it's recommended that Apple users follow along using the .numbers file available here.
